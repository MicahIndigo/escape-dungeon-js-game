## About

Escape Dungeon is a multi-puzzle text-based browser game. It is based on the escape room games, where players will have to complete different puzzles to escape the dungeon.

## Rationale 

I wanted to put a spin on your typical everyday games by including the escape room theme. I believe players will enjoy the added story elements as it gives the games an incentive
while keeping the experience refreshing. This is also a project I can continuosly update whether it be more levels or more games.
