## About

Escape Dungeon is a multi-puzzle text-based browser game. It is based on the escape room concept, where players must complete different puzzles to escape the dungeon. The game combines story-driven choices with classic puzzles for a fun and challenging experience.

## Rationale 

The aim of this project was to create a unique spin on traditional browser games by incorporating an escape room theme. Adding story elements provides context and motivation for completing puzzles, keeping the experience engaging and fresh. This project is designed 
to be easily extended with new levels and puzzles over time.
